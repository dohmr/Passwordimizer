### password generator

*Currently* only working options for Password Generator are if each variable is **true**, then the "correct" password length and characters are shown.
  *i.e. 'lowercase' uppercase' 'numeric' and 'special' characters.*

The deployed application can be found https://dohmr.github.io/Passwordimizer/

Repository can be found https://github.com/dohmr/Passwordimizer

To **operate** the app., the user clicks the button labeled 'Generate Password'
The user is then **prompted** with a series of questions.
First being, how many characters
Followed by, *'If lowercase...', 'If uppercase...', 'If numbers...', 'If special characters...'*
The user should be acknowledged if they selected an option(s).
The app. should then randomly generate a password covering the criteria requested.

Relied heavily on research of code to determine the correct logical steps, in order to initiate the proper code.
Found difficulties in applying features required.
Depended heavily on trial and error.

This project is open for addition, subtraction, division and multiplication! As of 09/12/2020 there are still issues with its operation.
